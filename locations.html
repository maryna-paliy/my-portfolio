            Previously, there was only a swamp in its place, in which a large
            number of turtles roamed. It is because of this place that it got
            its name. The quarry itself operated here until the 90s, but it was
            closed, it was quickly flooded with water, and now a lake is located
            here. The water in the Cherepashynetskyi quarry is very clean and
            transparent, so it is pleasant to swim here. Thanks to the plants
            and conifers that surrounded the lake, the air here is clean and
            fresh. Some of the plants here grow right out of the water.
